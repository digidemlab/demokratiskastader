quote: Loomio allowed us to expand on what would typically be the local town hall
  meeting, and reach many more people. We reached people that otherwise wouldn't have
  contributed to the conversation, including marginalised populations and youth.

## What is it and why should I use it?

Loomio is an online meeting tool. It’s easy to use and accessible, enabling you to engage with people in a facilitated conversation. Anyone can participate in decisions that affect them.

## How do I use it?

* Start a group to collaborate with people on Loomio
* Invite people into your group
* Start a discussion on any topic
* Make a proposal to see how everyone feels about a particular course of action
* Decide together - anyone can agree, abstain, disagree, or block – so you can see how everyone feels about the proposal.
